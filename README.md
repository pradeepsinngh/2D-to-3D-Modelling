# 2D-to-3D-Modelling
3D Modelling of 2D Objects (images) by roatating a solid image through 360 degree.

The basic purpose of this project, "2D to 3D Modelling" is to model the 3D view of 2D images, taken by rotating a solid image through 360 degree. 

We have used floowing hardware & software in this project:
# Hardware:
1.) Camera - Tech-Com-SSD-350 40 Mega Pixle Web Camera
2.) Microcontroller - Atmega 8
3.) Servo Motor
4.) FTDI USB to Serial Conveter

# Software:
1.) Matlab
